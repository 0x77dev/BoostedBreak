# __BoostedBreak__ - The Boosted Board Reverse Engineering Project 
## Overview
__BoostedBreak aims to be a comprehensive reverse-engineering project for Boosted Board products, created by __axkrysl47____.

Currently, __BoostedBreakCAN__ is the first and only project under __BoostedBreak__ - more projects to come later.

__BoostedBreak__ was made as an attempt to be a spiritual sucessor to [__rscullin's BeamBREak__ project](https://beambreak.org/).

## __BoostedBreakCAN__

__BoostedBreakCAN__ is the latest reverse-engineering breakdown of Boosted's CAN protocol that exists between V2/3 batteries & electronic speed controllers.

(A special credit goes to __David Wang__, founder of [__XR General Hospital__](https://www.xrgeneralhospital.com/), who helped source me the parts I needed to get this project off the ground.)

### Latest Release - v0.0.1
v0.0.1 is the initial published release of __BoostedBreakCAN__, a Visual Studio C++ project that interfaces with a [PCAN-USB adapter from PEAK-System](https://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-USB.199.0.html?&L=1).

## What's Next...

### __BoostedBreakCAN__

I (__axkrysl47__) am currently in the process of acquiring more Boosted products for testing. I will be sure to update __BoostedBreakCAN__ with any new findings I make.

Further, the SRB and XRB emulators, as well as 'brief mode', are not yet implemented and will require a good amount of effort to complete. If there is high enough demand, I can look to push those up my task list.

### __BoostedBreakBLE__

As soon as I acquire another remote for testing, I plan to start __BoostedBreakBLE__ to attempt to reverse-engineer Boosted's Bluetooth protocol that exists between V2/3 electronic speed controllers & remotes.
